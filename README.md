## 🥭 What is PhalFresh?

PhalFresh is an AI-driven computer vision model built to:

✔ Detect fruit type

✔ Identify whether fruit is fresh or rotten

✔ Predict remaining shelf life

✔ Deliver real-time predictions (<1 sec)

✔ Perform reliably even under low-light and mobile camera conditions

Built with CNNs, TensorFlow, OpenCV, and HuggingFace, it is optimized for real-world performance and ease of use.

## 🚀 Features at a Glance

🎯 97–99% Accuracy for fruit type classification

🍏 95–98% Accuracy for fresh/rotten detection

⏱️ Real-time inference via HuggingFace (<1s)

📱 Robust on mobile images & low-light scenarios

🧮 Shelf-life prediction based on ripening trends

🌐 Simple web interface for image uploads


## 🧠 How the Model Works

🔹 1. Preprocessing

Resizing

Normalization

Lighting adjustments

Augmentations to improve robustness

🔹 2. CNN Model

A custom-trained CNN that learns:

Texture differences

Color decay patterns

Rot and mold structure

Ripening characteristics

🔹 3. Prediction Pipeline

Fruit Type → Fresh/Rotten → Shelf-Life Estimation

Returns results in <1 second

🔹 4. Web Interface

A clean UI for uploading/capturing images.
